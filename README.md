## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Mine Water & Road Pump Management System(MERN)
- Built a centralized, secure dashboard to monitor pumps, sumps, and haul roads consitions, eliminating fragmented tracking and reducing operational risk from flooding, equipment failure, and delayed response. 
- Hardened backend security using IP-based rate limiting (global request throttling and stricter auth limits to mitigate brute-force attacks), Helmet security headers, and request payload size limits to prevent API abuse and DoS-style attacks.  
- Deployed on **Vercel (frontend)** & **Render (backend)**
